          The department of
          <span class="bold">Electronics and Communication Engineering</span>
          strives to produce top-notice engineers with global competence for
          industry, research and academia. The major objective of the department
          is to foster innovation, design and creation of eco-sustainable
          products and solutions to meet the growing technological demands. The
          department serves over 250 undergraduate students with a team of
          dedicated faculty members who are committed towards teaching and
          research in the
          <span class="bold"
            >areas of signal processing, electronic circuit design,
            communication systems, VLSI, machine learning, internet of things
            (IoT) and embedded systems.</span
          >
          The department has fully equipped laboratories with state of the art
          equipment for conducting laboratory courses, research and consultancy
          activities. The collaboration with industries such as national
          instruments, key sight technologies, Texas instruments and Pasco has
          aided the department in providing a good platform for the students to
          learn the concepts experientially and to work on real time industrial
          problems. The department associates with various industries to conduct
          one credit/value added courses for the students to bridge the gap
          between industry and academia, thereby enhancing their placement
          opportunities. The department also conducts national conferences every
          year to provide a platform to gather and disseminate the knowledge and
          results of original research and discussion of practical insights. The
          students are also provided
          <span class="bold"
            >guidance towards higher studies, research and entrepreneurial
            activities.</span
          >
          Holistic living classes are conducted to instill the spirit of ethical
          practices, human values and an attitude to serve the society. Students
          are encouraged to participate in the national level technical
          competitions hosted by the industries and other prestigious
          educational institutions and they have their own laurels in the legacy
          to their juniors. Apart from academics, our students also take part
          and organize several activities within the college, which fosters the
          organizational and leadership skills of students. Owing to the current
          pandemic scenario, faculty members and students have taken up various
          online MOOC courses through coursera, edx, udemy etc.., to hone their
          technical skills during the lockdown phase. Several webinars have been
          conducted by inviting resource persons from reputed organizations to
          help the students to keep pace with the trending technological
          advancements.
